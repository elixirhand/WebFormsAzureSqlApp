# WebFormsAzureSqlApp

Hi I did some work on suggested tests. For example
I created database, table, stored procedures in order to perform crud operations within Asp.Net Web Form app.
I developed asp.net web form application which has one form.
I used Entity framework ado.net with data first approach. After accessing the data I used EntityDataSource to populate the dummy Customer data in GridView and I also used the DetailsViews to insert new Customer.

So, Web Form application along with Azure SQL data base successfully deployed on azure under same resource group. 

Azure Sql Server with database is hosted on azure under following server. I noticed database is bit slow. I did not used load balancer and caching. 
webformsazuresqlappserver.database.windows.net

Web forms application is hosted on azure and can be accessed via this url. 
Not good design and there is no client or server side validation.

I created Web API using Linq to SQL classes approach to access data within apis. However, I the angularjs app is ready yet. I need one week to complete it. I did some work on in past, however I need to go through some documentation to finalize it. 

Complete Web Form project is available on github account and can be accessed via this link.
