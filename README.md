# WebFormsAzureSqlApp

Hi I did some work on your suggested tests. For example
I created database, table, stored procedures in order to perform crud operations within Asp.Net Web Form app.
Azure Sql Server with database is hosted on azure. Dtabase is bit slow. I did not used load balancer and caching. 
Serevrname: webformsazuresqlappserver.database.windows.net

I developed asp.net web form application which has one form.
I used Entity framework ado.net with data first approach. After accessing the data I used EntityDataSource to populate the dummy Customer data in GridView and I also used the DetailsViews to insert new Customer.

So, Web Form application along with Azure SQL data base successfully deployed on azure under same resource group and can be accessed via url. Not good design and there is no client or server side validation and no testing.

I created Web API using Linq to SQL classes approach to access data within apis. However, angularjs app is not ready yet. I need one week to complete it. I did some work in the past on AngularJs, however I need to go through some documentation to finalize it. 

Complete Web Form project source code is available on github account and can be accessed via this link.
